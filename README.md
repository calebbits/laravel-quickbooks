# laravel-quickbooks
## A nice wrapper around the Quickbooks Online SDK. 

###Installation
If you haven't already composer the quickbooks php sdk. If you're using php 7+ then you'll need to require the dev-master version.
```
composer require consolibyte/quickbooks-php
```
Then require this package.
```
composer require myleshyson/laravel-quickbooks
```
Add this line to you config/app.php.

```php
Myleshyson\LaravelQuickBooks\QuickBooksServiceProvider::class,
```

Finally on the command line publish the config file for the package like so.

```
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=quickbooks
```

These are the variables you need to set in your .env.

```
QB_TOKEN=
QB_OAUTH_CONSUMER_KEY=
QB_OAUTH_CONSUMER_SECRET=
QB_OAUTH_URL=
QB_SUCCESS_URL=
QB_SANDBOX=true

//These two you don't need to change unless you need to for some reason.
QB_USERNAME=DO_NOT_CHANGE_ME
QB_TENANT=12345 
```
After that you should be set to go!

###Usage
This package was made for working with the QuickBooks Accounting API in mind. You can look at all of the accounting resources here under 'Transaction' and 'Name list' resources. [QuickBooks Accounting API](https://developer.intuit.com/docs/api/accounting)

There are a few resources that aren't supported by the QuickBooks SDK and those are listed here:
* CompanyCurrency
* Budget
* JournalCode
* TaxAgency
* TaxService
* Deposit
* Transfer

To connect to quickbooks.

```php
// web.php
use Myleshyson\LaravelQuickBooks\Facades\Customer;

Route::get('/', function () {
  Connection::start();
});
```

If you want to disconnect from quickbooks then you can do it like so.
```php
// web.php
use Myleshyson\LaravelQuickBooks\Facades\Customer;

Route::get('/', function () {
  Connection::stop();
});
```


I used the same naming conventions as the QuickBooks API to make things easier. In order to create a resource like Customer for example, you would use it like this...

```php
// web.php

use Myleshyson\LaravelQuickBooks\Facades\Customer;

Route::get('/', function () {
    Customer::create([
        'Taxable' => false,
        'BillAddr' => [
            'Line1' => '123 Test Street',
            'City' => 'Dallas',
            'State' => 'Texas',
            'CountrySubDivisionCode' => 'TX',
            'PostalCode' => '12345'
        ],
        'GivenName' => 'Bill',
        'FamilyName' => 'Something',
        'FullyQualifiedName' => "Bill's Surf Shop"
    ]);
});
```
*Make sure to import the Facade class* 

Every resource that's available has four methods:

```php
Customer::create(array $data);

Customer::update($id, array $data);

Customer::delete($id);

Customer::find($id);

Customer::get(); //gets all customers associated with your account.
```
